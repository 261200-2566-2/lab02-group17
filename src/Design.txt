* using Airpurifier class from Main class

Airpurifier
===========================
        intheritance
===========================
varaible
- brand = "Xiaomi" (default)
- model 
- serial number 
- status = on || off
- mode = sleep / setting / auto
- filter typr = "Pleated Filter" (default)

method
- turn on <no need to pass argument> = set status to on 
- turn off <no need to pass argument> = set status to off 
- power consumtion <input = status> = if it turn off = 0  
                                    = if it turn on have to calculate
- changeMode <intput = mode number from button> = 1 sleep
             = 2 setting
             = 3 auto
- get data <no need to pass argument> = get data of airpurifier

===========================
           class
===========================

- manufacturedCount = 0 (default)
- modelSet = set of Model that have been manufactured

method
- mostPopularModel = get the most popular model
- argManufacturedCount = calculate and get the average count of every model




Sensor
===========================
        intheritance
===========================
varaible
- temperature;
- PM Level;

method
- measure temperature <no need to pass argument> = get data from temperature sensor
